<i><b>When I try to do something with the app, a small black rectangle appears and then disappears. What's happening?</i></b><br>
This happens when an error occurs in the application. It might be that there was bad data entered, or connection with the server was lost in transit. Try the action again, and if the problem continues. E-Mail or Call customer support so the issue can be addressed.<br><br>

<i><b>What does a "Force Close" mean?</i></b><br>
A "Force Close" will occur when the app has done something that causes it to crash. When this occurs, if the "Send Report" button is available, it's always good to press it; this will allow our developers to get detailed information on what caused the crash, so the problem can be addressed and fixed.<br><br>

<i><b>Can I take photos of equipment, customers or appointments? And where do they go?</i></b><br>
Yes! When viewing the details screen for customers, appointments, or equipment a small set of buttons appears on the app towards the upper-right hand corner. One which looks like a camera, and the other which looks like a grouping of 4 small squares. If you press the camera button, you can capture a photograph and description for the item you're viewing (either an appointment photo, a customer photo, or an equipment photo). The button of 4 small squares next to it, will launch the gallery where you can view submitted images. Images of customers is denoted with a blue figure to the left-had side, equipment is denoted with two tools crossing each other, and an appointment photo is denoted with a calendar logo.<br><br>

<i><b>Can I view photos taken by another technician?</i></b><br>
Yes! Anytime you view a gallery, any photos attached to the customer, appointment, or equipment will be visible, as well as the technician's name that submitted the photo as well as the date and time it was submitted along with a brief description. Photos can also be viewed by dispatch from the website.<br><br>

<i><b>How can I contact a customer from the app?</i></b><br>
By viewing the customer details there are many contact options. To view the customer details you can either go from the dashboard, and click the customers button, followed by selecting the appropriate customer, or by viewing an appointment and then clicking the "View Info" button to the right of the customer name. From the customer details page, you can contact a customer through phone call, text message, or email, by simply clicking on one of the buttons to the right of those fields.<br><br>

<i><b>How can I communicate with dispatch from the app?</i></b><br>
Communication with dispatch is important. To open a line of communication from the application, each job has a comments section. While viewing the appointment details, there is a button available to the technician titled, "View Comments". From the comments screen the technician can submit and receive comments with their dispatcher if questions, problems, or additional notes should arrise.<br><br>

<i><b>How do I view the hours I've worked?</i></b><br>
Using Service Skeds, hours are automatically saved and calculated for technicians. The time is calculated by comparing the differences in time when a status is updated for a job. These calculations are then combined for each of the technicians jobs to get a total time of hours worked. These times can be viewed by clicking on the "My Hours" button on the dashboard. The hours are divided into "Today", "This Week" and "Last Week"<br><br>

<i><b>How do I change my password?</i></b><br>
To change your password from the application, simply click the "Settings" button on the dashboard. On the settings view, simply fill in your current password and specify your new password in the fields provided and press the change password button. If the password changes successfully, the app will create a small pop-up letting you know it was successful, and your password for the application will update automatically.<br><br>

<i><b>How do I update my status?</i></b><br>
To update the status of a job, starting from the Dashboard, choose the "My Schedule" button, and select the desired appointment from the schedules list. From here simply press the "Update Status" button located in the upper right hand corner. A list of options will then slide up from the bottom of the screen, allowing the technician to choose the next status of the job. After a status is chosen the app will attempt to determine the technicians location for no more than 8 seconds, and then submit the status. <br><b>Note:</b> If an accurate location cannot be determined, the application will take one of several possible routes. <br>1) If the job status is "Started" or "Finished" it will take the address associated with the job.<br>2) If the job status is something other than "Started" or "Finished" and no accurate location was determined, the application will take the last known accurate position of the technician.<br><br>

<i><b>How do I know what my current status is?</i></b><br>
To view your current status, simply visit the dashboard of the application. Your status appears across the status bar located along the bottom of the screen. The status bar will label who the current logged in technician is working for, and the status of that job will be denoted by a colored indicator to the left. This indicator will be gray if the technician is not currently working, green if they still have an active or open appointment, and red if they have an appointment that has been paused or suspended.<br><br>

<i><b>When I view a status, I'm taken to a settings screen that says "Enable GPS" and I get stuck. What do I do?</i></b><br>
This screen appears to ensure that the application will be able to track the location of the technician when they go to update their status. To continue, make sure that both "Enable GPS Satellites" and "Use Wireless Networks" (or "Use Network Location") are both checked, and then press the back button to return the application.<br><br>

<i><b>How do I view appointments that happened in the past?</i></b><br>
To view appointments that took place and have already been closed out, start by going to the dashboard and then selecting the "Customers" button.

<i><b>How do I schedule appointments from the app?</i></b><br>
Currently, jobs can only be scheduled for the technician that is logged in at the time, not for others.

From the customer details page, simply click the "New Appointment" button located in the upper-left hand corner. Fill in the appropriate information, and press submit.<br><br>

<i><b>What does Pay/Close Appointment do?</i></b><br>
The "Pay/Close" status on appointments will make sure a job is closed out completly. This happens when a job will no longer need to modified for any reason by the technicians or dispatch. Closing a job, will remove it from the "Active" jobs list, and into the "Previous" jobs list.<br><br>

<i><b>What is the difference between upcoming appointments and my schedule?</i></b><br>
"Upcoming Appointments" is a little way to view the 3 or 4 most notable appointments for the technician without having to leave the dashboard. The "My Schedule" view, shows a list of all appointments, and is not limited to just a small few.<br><br>

<i><b>Can I edit notes for an appointment?</i></b><br>
Notes are provided for an appointment by dispatch, and are not editable by technicians to ensure that if an appointment has multiple technicians working, that everyone can see the same message. If technicians need to communicate with dispatch or each other, simply viewing the comments section of an appointment, they may choose to have dispatch change or update an appointments notes.<br><br>

<i><b>Why are finished jobs still on my "Active" appointments list?</i></b><br>
The "Finished" status means only that all work has been finished on the job itself, that a technician no longer is doing any work related to that job. Finished appointments will remain in the active list until the appointment is completely closed out, by pressing the "Pay/Close" status update.<br><br>
